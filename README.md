# Spam Detection NLP & Educational Game (In Progress)

This repository contains an **unfinished** NLP project that deals with: First, binary classification for **spam detection;** Second, recontextualizing the trained model as the "judge" in **a game.**

The general idea is that users compete to get the most spam-like response past the model's predictions without *actually* getting flagged as spam. This game is a tool in two senses: It operates *educationally* to show what words and what *sorts* of words are more "loaded" in this context, and it shows the data scientist behind the model (in this case me--hi!) potential *shortcomings or blindspots* in their model.

Right now, **the data** is sourced from this [Kaggle set](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/email-classification-nlp) but I intend on trying more datasets as this project moves forward.
